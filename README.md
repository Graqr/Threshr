## Summary

Threshr is java library wrappper capable of querying product information from varying Target's various api's, aimed 
at querying product pricing.


### Usage

see tests for [examples](https://github.com/Graqr/Threshr/blob/e643e9a7bde831d73587da0e55ae8799a9b79ee2/src/test/groovy/com/graqr/threshr). 

### Roadmap

I want to facilitate querying prices with these improvements:
 - something easier than including target store ID's when specifying target store locations
 - flesh out target's department & category information
 - flesh out products which can be queried
